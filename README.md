# Bubbles! And the power of Sketch.js

## Technologies

**sketch.js** is a tiny (~5k) boilerplate for creating JavaScript based creative coding experiments.

We'll also be using [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) today to make our code easier to write (less lines!)

Lastly, we'll be using CodePen as our preferred in-browser code editor today. Because this project will utilize coffeescript, sketch.js, and jquery, CodePen will make it easier to configure during our relatively short lesson. If you want some extra credit when we're done, try getting everything to run locally!


## Bubbles

Today, we'll be drawing on a canvas and then creating some cool hover effects whenever your mouse touches different elements on the page. There will be a lot of room for experimentation so feel free to create some cool effects of your own!

### Creating a new Pen

Visit [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) and click the "New Pen" button.

### Setting up the environment

In the top right corner of each section, there is a gear button that will allow you to access the settings for that piece of code. We're going to make a few modifications to make sure our environment is ready for the code we are about to write.

#### CSS Settings

Select "None" as the type of CSS.

Select "Reset" to reset style and elminiate browser inconsistancies.

Select "Prefix free" so you don't have to worry about vendor prefixes. This doesn't matter too much for what we are doing but if you start experimenting towards the end, it may help.

#### JavaScript Settings

Select "Coffeescript"

Select *Latest Version Of* **jQuery**
